Nija Developer Tools

Ihave found that with every new PrestaShop project, I am dealing with some common issues: Change the file permissions, run custom queries, compress and extract zip files, etc. It is not always so practical to upload a whole phpMyAdmin for database operations or write PHP system commands to create zip or tar.bz2 files, especially when you are dealing with clients who are not very eager to provide a control panel or SSH access. 
Also, this is not always possible to take an actual snapshot of the e-store at a single place. For example, I would like to see at a glance, the number of products, categories, carts, orders, and so on.
So I have put together some highly useful tools for some common tasks for Prestashop Developers. It includes:
Adminer, a formidable database manager. Highly useful for executing custom queries and database dump and restore. One of the most serious and lightweight alternatives to phpMyAdmin.
b374k, a feature-rich shell (SSH) emulator. Very handy for operations on the remote server, such as creating and extracting compressed archives and changing file permissions. You can also use it to upload files.
Most commonly used configuration parameters put together at the top of the module pages.
SimpleStats: A quick store overview.
Ability to turn error displaying on/off.
Ability to clear smarty cache.
As a  programmer, this module made my own life easier. I hope it will also be useful for you.
